MPPT PCB design in Simulink and Altium Designer 

## Final RESE412 assignment 1.pdf

This report, I explored the sizing of a nanogrid and a microgrid, performing a topology analysis. The analysis compares a community of individual nanogrids, with the more traditional method of microgrid design. Individual household power systems operating independently, versus a collective microgrid approach will be discussed.

When both the individual nanogrid and microgrid topologies are designed and simulated, I observed the losses within each topology to ascertain the efficiency of the systems. This information, along with the financial cost of the system will allow me to make a recommendation to a community as to which topology will be more economically viable in the long term.

- These techniques, including demand side management, will be applied to designing, constructing and testing a fit-for-purpose renewable energy system as shown elbroated in assignment 2.

## MPPT assignment 3 412 final and proofread.pdf

- Finally, an MPPT algorithm was designed in simulink and a PCB was fabricated in Altium Designer to further investigate the feasibility of employing a maximum power point tracker for a renewable energy system. Altough PCB design failed, it ultimately demonstrated my understanding of Altium designer and the design process of creating an MPPT.
