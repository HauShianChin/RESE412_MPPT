# RESE412_MPPT

MPPT PCB design in Simulink and Altium Designer 

- Techniques were used to design advanced, integrated renewable energy solutions for given situations; these situations were presented in assignment 1 which discusses the topology and the potential to host a renewable energy system for a nano-microgrid. 

- These techniques, including demand side management, will be applied to designing, constructing and testing a fit-for-purpose renewable energy system as shown elbroated in assignment 2.

- Finally, an MPPT algorithm was designed in simulink and a PCB was fabricated (discussed in assignment 3) in Altium Designer to further investigate the feasibility of employing a maximum power point tracker for a renewable energy system. Altough PCB design failed, it ultimately demonstrated my understanding of Altium designer and the design process of creating an MPPT.
